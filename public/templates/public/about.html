			SUBWAY is considered the “healthy alternative” to the quick service offerings available today.  We make a strong point of comparing our products with our competitors when it comes to the fat content of fast food today.  We consistently promote the quality and freshness of our product and continue to leverage one of the key features of our system – that we make each and every sandwich to the customer’s exact specifications.  The first SUBWAY sandwich shop was opened in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1965 by company co-founder Fred DeLuca.  In 1974, Fred and his business partner Dr. Peter Buck decided to begin franchising their restaurant, launching SUBWAY into tremendous growth, and providing almost unlimited opportunity for others to share in their prosperity!
